## Purpose of the software

### Software development process

In this software, the software development process we applied is **agile**

### Reason why chose this

The reason why we choose the agile software development process is because agile is **shorter** than the traditional waterfall **development time**, which allows the team to **quickly adapt to changes** according to customer needs during the development process, make changes to meet customer needs and **obtain greater customer satisfaction**. Due to the relatively short development time of the agile software development process, it can be **brought to market faster**, giving our software a **competitive advantage**. In addition, agile software development processes are **more collaborative**.

### Target market
